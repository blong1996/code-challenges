# Wedding Party Seating Solution
## Author: Brandon Long

To run my solution:
- Ensure that you have installed in your environment Python 3.0+. 
- From the terminal run `Python wedding_seating.py`
- The program will direct you on how to input tables and parties.

## Architecture overview
- The `models` package contains the classes `Party`, `Table`, and `Venue` and are 
used to represent parties, tables and the venue, respectively.
- `wedding_seating.py` contains the core logic for the program and makes use of the classes defined in `models.py`
